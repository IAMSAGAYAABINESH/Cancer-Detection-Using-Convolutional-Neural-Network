# Cancer-Detection-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Network

This project aims to develop a deep learning model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for 
the detection of adrenocarcinoma (Cancerous lung tissue) or healthy lung tissues using histopathological images from biopsy.

In the cancerpred.ipynb you can find the deep learning model (CNN) for training and testing the histopathological images from biopsy of the lung cells


In the lungcane.h5 file the weights from the deep learning model is saved.

In the app.py file a streamlit webapp is developed using the weights that was saved to predict the output of the inputted lung cell image
